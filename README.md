# SPUK (Static PUblisher of Knowledge)

## Description

SPUK is a Static Site Generator (SSG) designed for RDF Knowledge Graphs. It transforms RDF data into a browsable, static HTML website and also provides an API for programmatic access to the graphâ€™s entities.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

    * On Windows:
    
        ```
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    * On macOS and Linux:

        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

SPUK generates static HTML pages from an RDF Knowledge Graph (KG), allowing users to explore the data through a web browser. Additionally, it exposes an API for querying entities programmatically.

### Start the site and the API

If you are launching the code for the first time, before running the main script, make it executable:

    chmod +x main.sh

Start the static site generator and API server:

    ./main.sh

The website will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8001.

The API documentation will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

### Examples

...

## Testing

SPUK uses unit tests to ensure code quality and correctness.

If you are launching the testing units for the first time, make the test script executable:

    chmod +x test.sh

Run the test suite with:

    ./test.sh
